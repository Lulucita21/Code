<p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated jungle owl species, with attributes of wild species
    such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term
    for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An
    adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

    Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
    Asia,[6] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian
    subcontinent.

    From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[7] Fowl
    have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from
    the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[8][9][10]

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>Chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, chicken as a
    species were typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.[23][page needed][failed verification]

    Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[24]</p>

<P>Chickens are omnivores.[29] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and even
    animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[30] or sometimes young mice.[31]

    The average chicken may live for 5â€“10 years, depending on the breed.[32] The world's oldest known chicken lived 16
    years according to Guinness World Records.[33]</P>
